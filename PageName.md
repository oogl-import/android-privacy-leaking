## Disclaimer ##
This app is primarily meant for research ONLY.
All operations in this app are "working as intented", according to the Android Security Team.

## What can we do ##
This app proposes a demo, showing that we can read some private data from an android device, then send them out by network, without claiming any permission in AndroidManifest.xml

It's a common sense that we can read the privacy from external storage without claiming [READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) permission now, this app shows how to send them out secretly by networks, without claiming [INTERNET](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#INTERNET) permission.

## Which device will be impacted ##
This exploit works on the latest android 4.3, I think it works on all android releases too. ALL devices will be impacted.

## Which privacy will be impacted ##
All data in external storage, including
  * All photos, movies, documents
  * All private data generated by other apps, such as
    1. Apps and their data by [Titanium Backup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup) (10,000,000+ installs)
    1. Texts by [SMS Backup & Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore) (1,000,000+ installs)
    1. Contacts by [Super Backup : SMS & Contacts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idea.backup.smscontacts) (1,000,000+ installs)
    1. Files downloaded by browser

## When will android do something about this ##
The Android Security Team said that all operations in this exploit were "not a vulnerability" and "working as intended", so malwares could keep stealing the private data for a long time.

## How to deploy this exploit into an app ##
Use the MainActivity as a splash activity.

## Can anyone notice the stealing procedure? ##
I don't think so.

## What can we do on our own? ##
  * Turn on "Protect SD Card" in "Developer options" (Android 4.1+)
  * Keep an eye on the permission [SYSTEM\_ALERT\_WINDOW](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW)
  * Pray
